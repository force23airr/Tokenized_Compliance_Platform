This repo is for a plug-and-play on-chain infrastructure that enables banks, asset managers, private credit funds, and real estate firms to seamlessly tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) — such as Treasuries, private credit, and real estate — with built-in compliance, custody, and settlement automation.
Core Value Propositions

Seamless Asset Onboarding: Upload traditional asset data (e.g., loans, buildings, portfolios) and automatically convert it into tokenized, standardized digital assets.

Instant Compliance: AI-powered KYC/AML and jurisdiction checks integrated into onboarding — institutions stay fully compliant without manual review.

Trusted Custody: Direct API integrations with regulated custodians for holding underlying assets and managing token issuance securely.

Near-Instant Settlement: Enable 24/7 settlement and transfer of tokenized assets — cutting intermediaries, costs, and counterparty delays.

Liquidity Access: Provide institutional investors and family offices access to private credit, Treasuries, and real estate markets through digital liquidity pools.

Transparency & Reporting: Automated real-time reporting dashboards for regulators, auditors, and investors with on-chain traceability.

Institutional-Grade Simplicity: Abstract all blockchain complexity — firms never see wallet addresses or code, just clean interfaces with firm-verified names.
